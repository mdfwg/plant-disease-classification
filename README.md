mdfwg: make a good readme file to explain this repo
- model is too large so you can download in this link: 
- Code in ipynb for model building and training
- streamlit app ..
- etc

also make an instruction on how to deploy the streamlit app

# Plant Disease Classification

This repository contains a project for classifying plant diseases using deep learning. The project includes a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, a Jupyter Notebook for model building and training, and a Streamlit app for deploying the model as a web application.

## Project Overview

1. **Model**:  
   The trained CNN model is too large to include in this repository. You can download the model file from the following link:  
   [Download Model](https://example.com/download-model)

2. **Code for Model Building and Training**:  
   The Jupyter Notebook [`AI Portfolio - Plant Disease Classification.ipynb`](AI%20Portfolio%20-%20Plant%20Disease%20Classification.ipynb) contains the code for:
   - Dataset preparation
   - Model architecture definition
   - Training and evaluation
   - Saving the trained model

3. **Streamlit App**:  
   The Streamlit app in [`streamlit.py`](streamlit.py) allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf and get predictions for the disease class along with the confidence score. The app uses the trained model for inference.

## Features

- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training includes 38 classes of plant diseases.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- **Streamlit App**: A user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## How to Deploy the Streamlit App

Follow these steps to deploy the Streamlit app locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-classification.git
   cd plant-disease-classification
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is not available, manually install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit tensorflow pillow numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Download the Model**:
   Download the trained model from the provided link and place it in the model directory:
   ```
   model/cnn_plant_disease_classification_model.h5
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   Start the Streamlit app by running the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit.py
   ```

5. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Future Improvements

- Add more classes of plant diseases to the dataset.
- Optimize the model for faster inference.
- Deploy the app on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Heroku for wider accessibility.
